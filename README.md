# Flower-Reorganization
Learn the pictures through Convolutional Neural Networks, and classify the pictures according to the features of the image data
Collected flower images from Kaggle, The data set contains 2287 flower images. Divided the pictures into 3 classes: Rose, Daisy, and Sunflower
Translated the images to dataframe, includes Features and Class label.
Created CNN model, set model layers to fit train data of features (filter, kernel size, activation, and input shape
Plot the loss and accuracy curves for training and validation set
Reported the model accuracy and confusion matrix, the accuracy is 75%
